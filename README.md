# Task Lists

## Description

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple JavaScript task list. You've been provided with the HTML skeleton, but will need to implement the JS code in the `js/tasklist.js` directory.

### Bonus

1. Add jQuery UI Sortable to the list so that tasks can be dragged and dropped to reorder.
